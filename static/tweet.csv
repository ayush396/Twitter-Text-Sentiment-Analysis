Accelerating long-duration energy storage innovation can significantly reduce annual CO2 emissions and lay the foundation for a net-zero economy by 2050. https://t.co/P2I5OcQEXa,1727,😢
The @gatesfoundation is supporting GIISER which is working to increase the in-country capacity for rapid evaluation of variants on the African continent. This will help us better understand variants of concern and how the current vaccines may perform. https://t.co/yz9XWS4LWH,976,😃
South Africa did the right thing by reporting these cases. They have invested heavily in R&amp;D including genomic sequencing capabilities which have made it possible to quickly identify variants like Omicron and help the world respond appropriately.,1569,😃
Experts like Trevor Bedford have done an excellent job explaining what scientists have learned so far about the new variant of concern known as Omicron. https://t.co/cix77NasZs,324,😃
I made this video a few months ago to help explain what happens when a virus mutates. You can read more about the ways in which new variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic here: https://t.co/luwOHz0hbJ https://t.co/l058kxZHgZ,2934,😃
I usually read a lot of non-fiction books but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year: https://t.co/ef6sg8MTdV  Which do you like better?,2057,😃
There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. https://t.co/KrNPsGvcXv,2285,😢
When I was a kid I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. https://t.co/Ctv8WCNriN,2755,😃
I read a lot of great books this year. These were some of my favorites. https://t.co/t5AzHkm1z6,4558,😃

It’s hard to believe that it’s been 50 years since the 4004 kickstarted the PC era. I still remember reading about its release with Paul and dreaming about how the world's first microprocessor might shape the future. https://t.co/7MDhGok7t5,6384,😢
About 3.6 billion people—nearly half of the world’s population—lack toilets or use unsafe sanitation. This #WorldToiletDay I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved. https://t.co/ILNnK3ZkGA,3106,😢

Data on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students. This new tool makes that data publicly available—a critical step toward a more equitable higher ed system. https://t.co/o3C7TcHG9N,1416,😃
Poverty and the world’s top global health problems are closely connected. By improving one we can make progress towards fixing the other: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/Rcq40MlaXc,1077,😃
The effects of climate change are affecting many aspects of our lives. By working to minimize its effects we are also working to improve global health. However ending malaria needs to (and should) happen faster: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/jp5OK6SVaC,1299,😃
Nobody can be an expert in all things at once. To end malaria—or any disease—leaders from around the world need to collaborate to make sustainable progress: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/il2Q5eRjjR,590,😐
I recently had the chance to meet 36 incredible graduate students working to #endmalaria. Here are some of my favorite questions they asked.,2666,😐
To tackle the biggest global health challenges all countries must have access to vaccines and other health innovations. This $150M commitment from the foundation and @sida will help low- and middle-income countries get the essential supplies they need. https://t.co/BHHp2N6mH0,1816,😐
I recently met with 36 remarkable graduate students who made me more optimistic than ever that we can #EndMalaria. https://t.co/Sua3bsxuJl,1967,😐

Setting concrete goals is a critical first step to solving any problem. I’m impressed by @JohnDoerr’s approach to identifying the objectives and key results needed to track our progress on climate. https://t.co/LIJTxggTbd,1492,😃
COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic threat the world faces. I spoke to the #GrandChallenges community about the ambitious innovation agenda we need to end this crisis and be ready to respond to the next. https://t.co/VqGYfiOjQ4,2292,😐
Getting to zero carbon emissions isn’t optional. After #COP26 I am optimistic that we can meet the challenge. https://t.co/usp4V6VqCK,2346,😐
I’m proud that @Breakthrough Energy is a part of the First Movers Coalition. Our efforts with @wef @ClimateEnvoy and other partners will help to scale the clean technologies that will become the foundation of our net-zero future. https://t.co/TKm6ArTskA,1640,😃
Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID-19 vaccines. Increasing production of auto-disable syringes will help ensure low- and middle-income countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines. https://t.co/Acou25JVf5,2410,😐
I’m grateful for the leadership of our @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst public and private sector partners. By taking coordinated courageous climate action we can lower Green Premiums and deploy the clean technologies that will help us reach net zero. https://t.co/WIiWOwwBZK,1445,😃
Getting to zero emissions will be the hardest thing people have ever done. This was a great conversation about the power of innovation and what the world can accomplish if we work together. https://t.co/aF1dHBlclm,1802,😃

Our funding is only part of the solution. More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible.,1269,😃
Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare. That’s why we engaged partners like @MedsForAll and @OfficialUoM to find more affordable safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost.,1350,😃
We’ve done this before. In 2017 the @gatesfoundation worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lower-income countries.,256,😐
If we’re going to end the acute phase of the pandemic life-saving drugs like molnupiravir must be available to everyone who needs them. https://t.co/G6kxmIySGr,3080,😐

Reaching net zero will take bold action and creativity and the first cohort of @Breakthrough Energy Fellows makes me optimistic that we can propel a new industrial revolution. https://t.co/lTI121sg4Y,1596,😃
I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future. If the world makes the right investments and decisions now we can make things better next time. And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all. https://t.co/ZdYHMQt7qP,1507,😃
Still the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots.,1455,😃
Inequity in health is not new. Each year more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years.,2910,😃
The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf,1666,😐
